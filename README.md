# ecsp-book
Book for essentials of computer science and computer science principles, using javascript as a programming language.

The target audience for this book is a high school
level student who has no prior exposure to computer science. The goal is to build
the mental foundations for why and how computing works, inlcuding history as a supporting
tool. History is not just about the "what" happens, but also about they "why" of
how things are and provides context and a way of thinking about the concepts, since
this is how those who founded the science worked with them.

### Dependencies to compile the book
- LaTeX (EG [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/))
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pygments](http://pygments.org/download/)
- [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted)

Once everything is installed, you'll have to add the -shell-escape flag when you call LaTeX because of minted. Otherwise it will tell you to add it.

### Contributing
This book is a work in progress.

If you would like to help, please feel free to fork this project, make additions
or corrections, and submit a pull request to include your changes/additions.

I have chosen JavaScript as the first language. If you wish to use sections of the
book but introduce a different language, feel free to do that. If you add
to the non-language-specific topics, I would appreciate it if we can still merge
that content between languages.
